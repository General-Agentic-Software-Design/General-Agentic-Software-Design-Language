/*
   --- Step-by-Step Breakdown ---
   1. Strategy Definition: The STRATEGY block names the algorithm ("binary_search") and defines its constraints (O(log n) complexity).
   2. Precondition: PRECONDITION: input IS_SORTED tells the AI that this algorithm *only* works if the input is already sorted.
   3. Flow Application: In FLOW execute_search, we first ENSURE the list is sorted (a safety check), then APPLY the strategy.
      This tells the agent: "Write a standard binary search implementation here."

STRATEGY binary_search:
    ALGORITHM: "Iterative binary search"
    PRECONDITION: input IS_SORTED "Binary search requires sorted input"
    COMPLEXITY: O(log n)
    INPUT:
        sorted_list: List<Integer>
        target: Integer
    OUTPUT: Integer // Index or -1

FLOW execute_search(list, target):
    // Pre-condition check ensures algorithm validity
    // Transpiler should generate assertion or early return
    ENSURE list IS_SORTED
    
    // Delegate to the pure logic strategy defined above
    APPLY STRATEGY binary_search(list, target)
    RETURN result
