/* 
   A minimal Hello World example
   demonstrating basic component structure.

   --- Step-by-Step Breakdown ---
   1. Directives: CONTEXT and TARGET tell the transpiler this is a general-purpose design.
   2. Component Definition: COMPONENT Greeter creates a class/module named "Greeter".
   3. Interface: Defines the public method `say_hello` which returns a String.
   4. Flow: FLOW say_hello() provides the implementation logic—simply returning a literal string.
